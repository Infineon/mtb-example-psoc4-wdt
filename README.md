# PSoC&trade; 4: Watchdog timer interrupt and reset

This code example deals with the watchdog timer (WDT) of PSoC&trade; 4. The watchdog timer operates in two modes: the interrupt mode and the reset mode. In the interrupt mode, the LED toggles every second. When configured in the reset mode, the LED blinks thrice every 4.915 seconds with an interval of 500 milliseconds due to the watchdog resets. In idle mode, the system enters deep sleep mode to save power.

All the intervals used in this code example are configurable.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. By default, the code example works in WDT interrupt mode because the macro `WDT_DEMO` in main.c is set as `WDT_INTERRUPT_DEMO`. To make the WDT work in the reset mode, set the `WDT_DEMO` macro to `WDT_RESET_DEMO` in *main.c* as Figure 1 shows.

   **Figure 1. Accessing WDT operation modes**

   ![](images/modes.png)


3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   </details>

   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. Observe the status of LED based on different events summarized as follows:

**Table 1. LED status based on the macro `WDT_DEMO`**

 Project setting  |  LED status
 :------- | :------------
 `WDT_DEMO` set to `WDT_INTERRUPT_DEMO` | LED toggles on every WDT interrupt (interval of 1 s).
 `WDT_DEMO` set to `WDT_RESET_DEMO` with the blocking function   | After approximately 5 s, the device resets and the LED blinks thrice with a 500-ms interval to indicate a WDT reset.

The LED blinks once on a power cycle or an external reset event.

**Note:** The LED states are inverted for the CY8CKIT-149 kit. Macros `LED_STATE_ON` and `LED_STATE_OFF` have to be updated in main.c.

## Design and implementation

The WDT in PSoC&trade; 4 is a 16-bit timer and uses the internal low-speed oscillator (ILO) clock of 40-kHz as a source.
The accuracy of ILO is (- 50% to +100%). Therefore, the match value of WDT is set after compensating the ILO with IMO.
The firmware flow is as follows:

1. Set the 'ignore' bits for the WDT counter. In this project, it is set to '0'. This means that the counter works with full 16-bit resolution. This gives an interval of 1.6384 s (65536 ÷ 40 kHz) for the complete count. See the device architecture [TRM](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-PSoC_4100S_and_PSoC_4100S_Plus_PSoC_4_Architecture_TRM-AdditionalTechnicalInformation-v12_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f9433460188) Chapter 13. "Watchdog Timer" for more information.

2. Clear the pending WDT interrupt.

3. Enable the ILO, which is the source for the WDT. Start ILO measurement and get the value of `ilo_compensated_counts` that requires to be set after every interrupt match.

4. Write the match value. The WDT can generate an interrupt when the WDT counter reaches the match count. The match count is generated using `DESIRED_WDT_INTERVAL`.

5. For the interrupt mode, enable interrupt generation and assign the interrupt service routine(`wdt_isr`).

6. Enable the WDT.

7. Because the ILO has low accuracy, the `ilo_compensated_counts` are calculated and the match value of the WDT is updated following a WDT interrupt.

8.    The System is put into Deep Sleep in idle mode to save power. Because the watchdog timer works on a low-frequency clock (LFCLK), its operation will not be effected when the system is put into Deep Sleep mode. The watchdog timer interrupt will wake the device from Deep Sleep mode.


**Notes:**

1. In interrupt mode, the WDT is configured to generate interrupts at `WDT_INTERRUPT_INTERVAL_MS` intervals. The default value of `WDT_INTERRUPT_INTERVAL_MS` is 1000 milliseconds. The WDT generates an interrupt on reaching the match value. The WDT counter is not reset on match; it continues to count across the full 16-bit resolution. Therefore, the new match value of the WDT counter is generated and updated on every WDT interrupt event to generate an interrupt after one second from the present interrupt. The WDT interrupt flag is set inside the WDT interrupt service routine; it is checked in the main loop and the LED on the kit is toggled.

2. In reset mode, the WDT is enabled without configuring the ISR and interrupt interval. To demonstrate WDT reset, a blocking code `(while(1))` is present in the innermost `for` loop, which is enabled when `WDT_DEMO` is selected as `WDT_RESET_DEMO`. The firmware must clear the WDT interrupt before the third match event/interrupt. For normal applications, `Cy_WDT_ClearInterrupt()` should be called to clear the WDT interrupt before the timeout (3 * WDT counter time period) is reached. However, when `WDT_DEMO` is set as `WDT_RESET_DEMO`, the firmware will not clear the interrupt. Therefore, the WDT interrupt is not served, which leads to a device reset on the third interrupt.  The default reset interval is 4.915 seconds (= 3 * 1.685). It can be reduced by increasing the value of ignore bits in the `IGNORE_BITS` macro.

3. Because the ILO has low accuracy (-50% to +100%), `ilo_compensated_counts` needs to be periodically calculated using the IMO (+/- 2%).

4. Upon every device reset, the firmware checks whether the reset event is caused by the WDT. If a reset event occurred due to the WDT, the LED blinks thrice with an interval of `DELAY_IN_MS`. If not, it will blink once with the interval of `DELAY_IN_MS`.

5. You can configure the values of the WDT interrupt interval, LED Blink interval, WDT interrupt priority, and a number of ignore bits using macros in *main.c* as shown in Figure 2 and update them.
